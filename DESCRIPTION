Description: ready4fun is a toolkit for authoring and documenting
    functions that extend the ready4 model of systems shaping mental
    health and wellbeing in young people. The toolkit aims to help all
    developers contributing to ready4 to adopt a common house style in
    authoring and documenting functions. The current version of this
    software is a development release, which you should only trial if you
    feel confident you understand what it does and have created a sandpit
    area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any
    questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
