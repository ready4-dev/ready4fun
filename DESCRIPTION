Description: ready4fun is a toolkit for authoring and documenting
    functions that implement algorithms for models developed with the
    ready4 framework (https://www.ready4-dev.com/). The toolkit aims to
    help all developers contributing to ready4 to adopt a common house
    style in authoring and documenting functions.  The current version of
    this software is a development release, which you should only trial if
    you feel confident you understand what it does and have created a
    sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have
    any questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton1@monash.edu).
