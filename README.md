ready4fun is a collection of functions for
authoring code libraries of functions and datasets for use in mental
health simulations developed within the ready4 ecosystem.  This
development version of the ready4fun package has been made available
as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. That
means this should be regarded as UNTESTED software, which is provided
for free WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. Importantly, the tools contained in
this test release automate a number of tasks which MODIFY THE
DIRECTORY STRUCTURE OF YOUR LOCAL MACHINE.  While we welcome and
appreciate anyone who takes the time to provide us with feedback on
this test release, we caution you that you should only test this
software if you feel confident you understand what it does and have
created a sandpit area in which you can safely undertake testing. If
you have any questions, please contact the authors
(matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).

If you plan on testing this software you can install it by running the following commands in your R console:

```r
install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("readyforwhatsnext/ready4fun")
