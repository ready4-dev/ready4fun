Description: ready4fun is a toolkit for implementing a standardised
    workflow to author and document functions that extend the ready4
    framework for open science computational models of mental health
    systems. The current version of this software is a development
    release, which you should only trial if you feel confident you
    understand what it does and have created a sandpit area in which you
    can safely undertake testing. If you have any questions, please
    contact the authors (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
