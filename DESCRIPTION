Description: ready4fun is a collection of functions for authoring and
    documenting code libraries of functions for use in modular,
    open-source mental health systems models. The current version of this
    software is a development release, which you should only trial if you
    feel confident you understand what it does and have created a sandpit
    area in which you can safely undertake testing. If you have any
    questions, please contact the authors
    (matthew.hamilton@orygen.org.au).
