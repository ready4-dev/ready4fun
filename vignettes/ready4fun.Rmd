The tools in ready4fun are designed to make it easier to author the functions that implement module algorithms for [ready4 - an open source health economic model of the systems shaping mental health and wellbeing in young people](https://www.ready4-dev.com).

This development version of the `ready4fun` package has been made available as part of the process of testing and documenting the package. 

A brief overview of the intended use of `ready4fun` classes and methods is available at:
